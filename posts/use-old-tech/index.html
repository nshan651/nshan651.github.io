<p>Technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and people often feel like they need the latest devices in order to not get left behind. There&rsquo;s a strong temptation to upgrade one&rsquo;s old devices as soon as new models hit the market. While this may seem like a natural progression, it has led to a significant increase in electronic waste, which is harmful to the environment. One way that you might be able to reduce your own E-waste is by buying or refurbishing an old laptop.</p>
<p>The majority of computer users <em>don&rsquo;t need a modern computer.</em> The average person only uses their laptop as a portal to the web. Occasionally, one might use Microsoft Word or even Excel, but these have largely been replaced by Google Docs, Sheets, and Microsoft&rsquo;s own web-based variants of their office suite. None of these use cases requires a modern device.</p>
<h1 id="who-needs-a-modern-computer">Who needs a modern computer?</h1>
<p>There are several use cases where modern hardware may be necessary. Here are a few instances where older laptops might not cut it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Professional-level video rendering and editing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional video editing and rendering can be quite computationally demanding. Modern machines with high-end graphics cards, large amounts of RAM, and fast processors are sometimes necessary for efficient video creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heavy scientific computing workload.</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing any kind of high performance computing, such as training an AI model or large-scale simulations, will of course require powerful custom hardware to match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most modern triple-A titles require a high-end graphics card and CPU to run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using poorly written, unoptimized software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often the thing causing a computer&rsquo;s performance to atrophy is software, not hardware. As computational ability has scaled with Moore&rsquo;s Law (the doubling of transistors on a microchip every two years), software has gladly taken advantage of the extra processing power. In some cases this has been beneficial and has even led to entirely new fields, such as machine learning and cryptography. However, the reduced constraints on performance have led to bloated and buggy software. With more memory and processing power to work with, developers can take shortcuts that may undermine performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t use their computers for computationally intensive tasks like rendering, scientific computing, or gaming, and it&rsquo;s this group of people who should consider an older computer. The last point about using unoptimized software can be a bit trickier to avoid, especially if you are using proprietary software that doesn&rsquo;t really have an alternative, such as Adobe PhotoShop or AutoCAD. However, using performant software is essential for a smooth experience on older hardware.</p>
<p>If you are someone like me and don&rsquo;t use their computer for any of these specialized tasks, then consider an older laptop the next time you need to purchase a computer. It can benefit both your wallet and the environment.</p>
<h1 id="e-waste-by-the-numbers">E-Waste by the Numbers</h1>
<p>Electronic waste is a growing environmental concern due to the increasing amounts of discarded electronics that end up in landfills or are improperly disposed of. While many different types of electronics contribute to the e-waste problem, discarded computers and laptops can be particularly hazardous if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Laptops and other electronics contain a variety of toxic substances, including heavy metals, flame retardants, batteries, and circuit boards. These substances can leach out of discarded electronics over time and contaminate the environment. This can lead to soil, air, and water pollution, which can in turn cause negative health effects for humans and wildlife.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium are common in electronics and can cause neurological damage, kidney damage, and respiratory problems when released into the environment. Flame retardants, which are used to prevent fires, can be toxic to humans, causing hormonal disruptions and developmental problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batteries contain toxic chemicals such as cadmium, lead, and lithium. Improper disposal of batteries can cause these chemicals to leak into the environment, leading to pollution and health risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circuit boards, which are essential components of electronic devices, contain small amounts of lead and other metals. These metals can be hazardous to human health and the environment if not properly recycled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When laptops and other electronics are discarded in landfills or incinerated, these hazardous substances can leach into the soil and water, polluting the environment and potentially harming human health. A study by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition found that as many as 75% of laptops ended up discarded in landfills. It&rsquo;s hard to determine what proportion of these laptops are in a useable or reparable state, but I suspect that many of them are perfectly functioning, &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; devices. Moreover, the study found that only about 15% of e-waste is properly recycled, which means that a significant amount of laptops are ending up in landfills or being incinerated.</p>
<p>Another study done by the United Nations University in 2019 came to a similar conclusion, finding that the world generated 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste, only 17.4% of which was properly recycled. They found that e-waste is the fastest-growing stream of waste in the world, and that improper disposal of e-waste can lead to environmental pollution and health risks.</p>
<h3 id="e-waste-in-schools">E-Waste in Schools</h3>
<p>E-waste from laptops has become a huge problem in schools. Chromebooks were then seen as a cost-effective way to conduct online classes during the pandemic, so schools bought them up in bulk and sent them home with students. However, the hope of saving money didn&rsquo;t quite pan out. Many of the batches that were first purchased three years ago are already beginning to break. This <em>Chromebook churn</em> has made school reconsider the affordability of Chromebooks.</p>
<h1 id="psychological-and-economic-factors">Psychological and Economic Factors:</h1>
<p>There are numerous reasons for why demand for new tech is constantly reaching new heights.</p>
<h3 id="planned-obsolescence">Planned Obsolescence</h3>
<p>Planned obsolescence is a marketing strategy used by manufacturers to encourage consumers to replace their existing products with newer models. This practice is prevalent in the technology industry, and it is a significant factor contributing to the production of e-waste.</p>
<p>Laptop manufacturers often design their products to become outdated quickly, forcing consumers to upgrade to newer models. They achieve this through a variety of methods, including the use of proprietary hardware and software, software updates that make older models run slower or not at all, and discontinuing support for older devices. These tactics encourage consumers to purchase the latest and greatest laptops, leading to a cycle of constant consumption and disposal of electronics.</p>
<p>Another aspect that exacerbates the e-waste problem is the increasing difficulty of repairing modern laptops. In the past, laptops were designed to be easily repairable, with replaceable parts and accessible hardware. However, modern laptops are often sealed shut, making it difficult or impossible for users to repair them themselves. This not only limits the lifespan of the laptop but also leads to more waste as consumers are forced to discard the entire device when a single component fails. Manufacturers also limit the availability of spare parts and service manuals, making it challenging for repair technicians to fix laptops. As a result, the throwaway culture has become more widespread, leading to a rapid increase in e-waste.</p>
<h3 id="materialism">Materialism</h3>
<p>This desire for novelty is often fueled by clever marketing campaigns that create a sense of urgency to upgrade to the newest product. Additionally, some consumers view their laptops as status symbols, and buying the latest model can signal their wealth or social status.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-consumer-awareness">Lack of Consumer Awareness</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a general lack of consumer awareness that an older computer can work just as well for their needs. Many consumers believe that they need the latest and greatest technology to keep up with modern applications, even if they don&rsquo;t use them all. This misconception is fueled by clever marketing campaigns that promote the newest products as essential for daily use. Moreover, consumers may be unaware that they can upgrade the hardware and software of their existing devices to improve their performance and extend their lifespan.</p>
<h1 id="what-can-you-do">What Can You Do?</h1>
<p>It can be hard to know where to start when it comes to purchasing an older laptop. Fortunately, there are lots of excellent guides online that will direct you toward quality, upgradable hardware, as well as tips and tricks on software that will give you the most mileage out of older computers. Some of my favorite resources are <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/">The Cheapskate&rsquo;s Guide to Computers and the Internet</a> and <a href="https://www.notechmagazine.com/">No Tech Magazine</a> (the latter of which is hosted almost entirely on solar power).</p>
<p>In general, I recommend looking into IBM ThinkPads and the Dell Latitude series of laptop.
Both are known for their reliability and driver support, as well as their wide availability. There&rsquo;s a huge secondhand market for old ThinkPads, it&rsquo;s not hard to find a used device on Ebay or Craigslist for under $100.</p>
<p>As far as software, I recommend looking into the Linux operating system. There&rsquo;s no platform that supports legacy hardware better. Linux has made huge strides in recent years toward being accessible to a wider, non-technical audience. I would personally recommend a distribution such as Debian Stable or Linux Mint for an easy setup and virtually no further maintenance required (see <a href="https://www.suse.com/suse-defines/definition/linux-distribution/">here</a> for an explanation of what a distribution is).</p>
<h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>While there are instances where modern hardware is necessary, many people do not require it for their daily computing needs. Using an older laptop can be both cost-effective and environmentally friendly, as it reduces electronic waste. Electronic waste from laptops is a growing problem that can lead to pollution and health risks, and it is important to properly dispose of old electronics to avoid these issues. As we continue to advance technologically, it is important to consider the impact on the environment and to make conscious choices when it comes to upgrading our devices. By reducing electronic waste, we can help preserve our planet for future generations.</p>
